v0.2.0 (UPCOMING)
# NOTICE: REMEMBER TO REVERT SENTRY CURRENT_EXPERIMENT AND DATAHANDLER LOAD_RAW BEFORE RELEASE
-----------------
Added: 
 - Setting to hide valve sensors
 - Prevent plotting of sample pressure when it is far from origin pressure
 - Hide sample sensor when it is disconnected
 - Sentry shuts device down if in experiment mode and:
    - pressure does not increase after rapid pump events
    - average pressure difference over periods exceeds 25% twice in a row
 - Log files store coefficients, so they can be correctly viewed on other machines

Changed:
 - Reset history plots when new log starts
 - Shutdown button is now momentary contact
 - Update README
 - Prevent multiple pressurizes per depressurize on history plot
 - Sentry only compares pressure right before events rather than looking for slope changes
 - Remove mouse coordinates when mouse leaves a plot

Fixed:
 - Significantly increase accuracy of pump stroke detection
 - When loading raw data files, replay file rather than raising an exception at EOF
 - Fixed pump stroke rate being multiplied by 2
 - Allow deletion of open log files
 - Catch exception when opening log file of improper format
 - Prevent deleting a log file twice if no events are logged
