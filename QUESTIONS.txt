1. Pulses:
    What should its duration be? 
    How precise is necessary? currently getting -.25ms to +.75ms (may be less if increase device Hz)
2. If the controls for the app and the main console differ, which takes precedence?
3. What happens when you click shutdown?
    Guess: Close all valves
4. Should pulsed mode depressurize or pressurize first?
