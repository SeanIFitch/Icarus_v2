Add text file for keeping settings
    pressure offset
    device info
    buffer size

Add method for setting pressure offset at 1 atm

Possibly: split Di4108USB into 2 classes, one for configuration which can be loaded from a file
    Allows easier change of device/easier edit of read settings

Change to 1 buffer for all data which uses a large array rather than a list of arrays

Check if pressure math is right. Seems the same type of sensor should report the same voltage for the same pressure, but this has different offsets.
