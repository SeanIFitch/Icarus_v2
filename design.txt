pressure right before depressurization (for entire experiment) rather than difference on upper right
keep slope under that

reset history is only reset the all time charts

add some sort of slider to control amount of history displayed

pressure target & sample is important - make it big

update history charts on depressurize

logger - include data from press/depress events, history

sentry - all rules for shutdown

modes - detect experiment (is presurization from buttons or console) - then disable buttons

test valves by presurizing and seeing whether it changes - history charts need improvement
	timeout investigates this?

pulldown menu - settings more organized
	valve counters need to be able to be changed for software replacements
	log history / save traces - what are these? are they necessary?
	Show high-pressure sample sensor readings - move this to somewhere more accessible

predict leaks, give warnings
	data sets comparison between days
	eventually have reference curves
		kalman filter?


High pressure: 50kPsI = 5V
